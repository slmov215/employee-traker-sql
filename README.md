## Installation
### Node.js is required to run this application. Please run the command "node-v" to check and visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) website to install.

* First you will need to clone this repository to your computer. [Link](https://github.com/slmov215/employee-traker-sql)
* Next, open your terminal and run the command "npm i' to install the required dependencies. 
* After you've downloaded the packages, run the command "mysql -u root -p" in the terminal and enter your personal MySQL password.
* Following after that, run the command "source schema.sql" and "source seeds.sql" (Where these commands will create the employee_db database and seed the database with a set of mock datas.).

## Usage
* Open terminal from the "index.js" file
* Next, run the command "npm start".
* Then, select a desired task using the arrow keys
* After following the Inquirer prompts, you will be taken back to the main menu.
* Choose another task or exit the application (By choosing "EXIT").

### Refer to the video demonstration below, where it will show the full functionality of the application.
